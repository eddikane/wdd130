      <h3>Teams & Match Info</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Road to the Final:</strong><br>
  PSG emerged from a competitive group stage and demonstrated their maturity in the knockouts. Wins over Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Arsenal showcased not only their technical quality but also tactical growth. Luis Enrique's side is fast, aggressive, and cohesive — a dramatic shift from their past reliance on individual brilliance.
</p>
<p>
  Inter Milan’s campaign has been defined by consistency and resilience. They topped their group and edged past tough opponents in the knockout stages. Their 7–6 aggregate win over Barcelona in the semifinals was one of the most dramatic encounters in Champions League history.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Key Players to Watch:</strong><br>
  PSG's Ousmane Dembélé has been in career-best form, contributing goals and assists at crucial moments. Donnarumma brings calm and experience in goal, while January signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has added fresh energy and creativity.<br>
  Inter’s Lautaro Martínez leads their frontline with deadly precision. Hakan Çalhanoğlu controls the tempo in midfield, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan offers leadership and the rare chance to complete a personal treble of all major European titles.
</p>
<p>

      <h3>Travel & Viewing Guide</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Venue Overview:</strong><br>
  The Allianz Arena in Munich is one of Europe’s premier football stadiums. Opened in 2005, it is home to Bayern Munich and known for its illuminated exterior. For the final, fans will find upgraded services including expanded food zones, enhanced security, and fan-friendly signage in multiple languages.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Travel Tips:</strong><br>
  For fans traveling to Munich, the city is served by Munich International Airport (MUC), located just 28 kilometers from the stadium. From the airport, the S-Bahn trains (S1 and S8) offer a direct route to central Munich. From there, U-Bahn Line U6 takes fans directly to the “Fröttmaning” stop, which is just a few minutes from the arena. Visitors are encouraged to plan travel early, as the city will be busy with supporters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fan Zones & Watch Parties:</strong><br>
  UEFA has organized multiple fan zones across Munich, including the iconic Marienplatz, where large screens, food vendors, and live entertainment will entertain thousands. Additionally, cities around the world — from Paris to New York — will host official watch parties, ensuring fans can share the atmosphere even from afar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Home Viewing Ideas:</strong><br>
  Can’t make it to Munich? Bring the Champions League experience home! Decorate with club colors, serve themed snacks (like Parisian pastries vs. Milanese pizza), and create a prediction game for halftime fun. UEFA will provide downloadable materials like printable lineups, score sheets, and coloring pages for kids. Hosting a watch party? Encourage fans to wear jerseys and wave flags to bring the stadium spirit to your living room.
