      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Q1: Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</strong></p>
        <p>Absolutely! This is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more than children especially when they are allowed to share their own raft. A common concern we get from parents is the overall level and perception of how mild or difficult the river is. Our specially selected river has smooth entry points. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories... some of which are even true!</p>

      <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Q2: Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes! All whitewater rafting trips are an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and all staff with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears a coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non-swimmers go rafting and have a great time. Your guide will get you in an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

      <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Q4: What do I need to bring?</strong></p>
        <p>What you need to bring will depend on temperature and weather changes in the Canyon so its best to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet. Rain jacket and rain pants do more than perhaps could. Dry shirts and shorts keep the inner cotton shirt and pants helps keep you cooler and not soggy. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck. Use Lightweight Cotton Pant. Nylon Pant or Shorts are the best thing for wet areas are swim trunks and shorts if you are not cold natured. Bring polypropylene underwear and sleeping bottom (women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as base layer clothing in the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if not). On the river you will need warm quiet synthetic long underwear top in the evenings. For hat wear a billed cap fitted to head, tied on with a chin cord. Avoid camper sunhats, and stringy girly ones that blow off and flop around. Put outer feet in swim shoes or water shoes if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before or camp shoes. Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options. Sleep wear: You might choose sleep in your inner canyon wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. Waterproof ground mats pack or thick less moisturizing travel binolane or flashlight mole skin waterproof sunscreen and lip balm optional items: gloves fleece jacket towel bandana small pillow hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo camera equipment, books, notebooks.</p>

        <p><strong>Q5: What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</strong></p>
        <p>Are you kidding me? It's hard to match the thrill of whitewater rafting. Let’s describe a common day on the river. You wake up from your slumber with the cool breeze and soft green jungle brushing the top of your face. Breakfast is fresh blueberries pancakes or omelets to order, then gear up your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with fun, beauty and history. Native ruins, caves, hikes, shady grottos, springs and more food. If you are lucky, you’ll see a beaver, or a big horn sheep, or even an eagle. After lunch is a good book, a nap or maybe even time to play a river game with your guide — just in time to hit the afternoon whitewater and ride some real action, or go swimming. Evenings are the best part, where you won’t forget the songs, stories and games. After it’s more relaxing and you might even be able to talk with your guide about river stories or your fellow campers about more stars than you thought possible.</p>

      <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Q6: How far in advance do I need to book my trip?</strong></p>
        <p>Depending on the season and flexibility, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
