    <h2>Edward Kane</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Edward Kane, I am originally from Lagos, Nigeria. Located in the western region of Africa. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am married with a little boy and we have got a little girl due in the middle of this semester. </p>
    <p>My favorite scripture right now is 2 Nephi 9:7-10. With it being Easter season, I find a lot of testimony strengthening information in this scripture. Most importantly, I find that i can rely on my Saviour in the hardest of times. I am looking forward to learning with you all this semester. </p>
